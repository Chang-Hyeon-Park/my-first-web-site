    I used to rule the world <br>
    Seas would rise when I gave the word <br>
    Now in the morning, I sleep alone <br>
    Sweep the streets I used to own <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I used to roll the dice <br>
    Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes <br>
    Listen as the crowd would sing <br>
    Now the old king is dead, long live the king <br>
    One minute I held the key <br>
    Next the walls were closed on me <br>
    And I discovered that my castles stand <br>
    Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing <br>
    Roman Cavalry choirs are singing <br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield <br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field <br>
    For some reason I can't explain <br>
    Once you go there was never, never an honest word <br>
    And that was when I ruled the world <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It was a wicked and wild wind <br>
    Blew down the doors to let me in <br>
    Shattered windows and the sound of drums <br>
    People couldn't believe what I'd become <br>
    Revolutionaries wait <br>
    For my head on a silver plate <br>
    Just a puppet on a lonely string <br>
    Oh, who would ever want to be king? <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing <br>
    Roman Calvary choirs are singing <br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield <br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field <br>
    For some reason I can't explain <br>
    I know Saint Peter won't call my name <br>
    Never an honest word <br>
    But that was when I ruled the world <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh <br>
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh <br>
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh <br>
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br>
    Roman Calvary choirs are singing<br>
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br>
    My missionaries in a foreign field<br>
    For some reason I can't explain<br>
    I know Saint Peter won't call my name<br>
    Never an honest word<br>
