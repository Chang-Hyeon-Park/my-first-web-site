    <h2>Coldplay_Fix_you</h2>
    <p>
    When you try your best, but you don't succeed <br>
    When you get what you want, but not what you need<br>
    When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep<br>
    Stuck in reverse<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And the tears come streaming down your face<br>
    When you lose something you can't replace<br>
    When you love someone, but it goes to waste<br>
    Could it be worse?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Lights will guide you home<br>
    And ignite your bones<br>
    And I will try to fix you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And high up above, or down below<br>
    When you're too in love to let it go<br>
    But if you never try, you'll never know<br>
    Just what you're worth<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Lights will guide you home<br>
    And ignite your bones<br>
    And I will try to fix you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Tears stream down your face<br>
    When you lose something you cannot replace<br>
    Tears stream down your face, and I<br>
    Tears stream down your face<br>
    I promise you I will learn from my mistakes<br>
    Tears stream down your face, and I<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Lights will guide you home<br>
    And ignite your bones<br>
    And I will try to fix you<br>
    </p>
