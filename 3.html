    Look at the stars <br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    And everything you do<br>
    Yeah, they were all yellow<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I came along<br>
    I wrote a song for you<br>
    And all the things you do<br>
    And it was called Yellow<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    So then I took my turn<br>
    Oh, what a thing to have done<br>
    And it was all yellow<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
    (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
    (Aah) you know, you know I love you so<br>
    You know I love you so<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I swam across<br>
    I jumped across for you<br>
    Oh, what a thing to do<br>
    'Cause you were all yellow<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I drew a line<br>
    I drew a line for you<br>
    Oh, what a thing to do<br>
    And it was all yellow<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones<br>
    (Ooh) turn into something beautiful<br>
    (Aah) and you know<br>
    For you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
    For you, I'd bleed myself dry<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It's true<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for-<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    Look how they shine<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Look at the stars<br>
    Look how they shine for you<br>
    And all the things that you do<br>
